# ⚠️ Self-Discipline & Accountability System

This learning journey is based on consistency and dedication. To ensure self-discipline, I have set up a system that holds me accountable if I miss a day of learning.

## 📢 Important Note:

This plan is designed for individuals who truly want to master Python without using the internet for learning. However, using the internet for debugging and problem-solving is acceptable.

#### 🔥 Penalty System

If I miss a learning day, I must complete extra tasks as a penalty:

### 🔥 Penalty System

| Missed Days | Penalty Task                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1 Day**   | Solve 5 additional coding problems the next day. |
| **2 Days**  | Complete an extra mini-project over the weekend. |
| **3+ Days** | Restart the current week from Day 1.             |

🚀 The goal is to stay consistent and push myself to become better every day!
